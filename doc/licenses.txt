H-Craft Championship source
***
The license for the sources is mentioned in each source-file.
But in general it is the zlib-license. The full text can be found in src/licenseHCraft.txt.

TinyXml is a lib include inside the H-Craft sources.
TinyXml uses a zĺib-style license which is in all it's source files, for example in src/tinyxml/tinyxml.h

***
H-Craft Championship media
***
The media is restricted and may not be distributed, changed or used in other products than H-Craft Championship.
We allow people to use it privately, but any kind of re-distribution is forbidden.
This will likely never change as a lot of media is based on licenses which won't allow us to liberate the media any further.

There are the following exceptions to that:
The font Andika is using the open font license which can be found at: media/ui/andika/OFL.txt

The songs 2'25'31 and Dream on from Manolo Camp are under a creative commons license. See media/sounds/music_level/license.txt
Or contact the music author at http://www.manolocamp.net/

Irrlicht uses a zĺib-style license which can be found in libs/irrlicht/include/irrlicht.h
Irrlicht_ogl-es (used only for Android) uses a zĺib-style license which can be found in libs/irrlicht/include/irrlicht.h
zlib licences can be found in libs/irrlicht/source/Irrlicht/zlib/zlib.h
jpeglib license can be found in libs/irrlicht/source/Irrlicht/jpeglib/README. You have to mention it's use when using it in your product.
libogg uses a bsd-style license which can be found in libs/libogg/libogg-<version>/COYPING
libvorbis uses a bsd-style license which can be found in libs/libvorbis/libvorbis-<version>/COPYING
libfreetype can be used under a bsd-style or a GPLv2 license. See details at libs/libfreetype/freetype-<version>/docs/LICENSE.TXT
sdl uses a lgpl license which can be found in libs/sdl/SDL-1.2.11/COPYING. Note that newer SDL2 will use a more libaral license, H-Craft just hasn't updated to it yet. Also SDL is only used for PC joysticks, so not used in the Android port.
freealut uses a lgpl license which can be found in libs/freealut/freealut-<version>/COPYING
openal-soft (used on Linux and Windows) uses a lgpl license which can be found in libs/openal-soft-<version>/COPYING
openal-soft-apportable (used on Android) uses a lgpl license which can be found in libs/openal-soft-apportable/COPYING. Note that lgpl and proprietry Android products are somewhat of a legal grey area. I can't tell you if that would be OK or not. In doubt try using another sound implementation or get a lawyer.
tremor (only used on Android) uses a bsd-style license which can be found in libs/tremor/tremor-<version>/COYPING. You have to put the full license text in your product when using this.
